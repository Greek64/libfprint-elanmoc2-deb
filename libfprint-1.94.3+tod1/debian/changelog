libfprint (1:1.90.7-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  * gbp.conf: Prepare for experimental branching
  * debian/patches:
    - Use hwdb to store device autosuspend rules and drop debian specifics.
      Upstream will use an hwdb to store the device autosuspend (that will be
      included in systemd also, so libfprint packagin may stop shipping it at
      later point), so use it earlier.
      Drop the debian specific rules to set the devices part of the `plugdev`
      group as such devices should not be ever readable by an user, but the
      access should be managed through a libfprint-based service (frpintd at
      the date).
    - Explicitly mark libfprint as a shared library
  * libfprint-2-2.install: Install hwdb file
  * debian/rules:
    - Do not autorename upstream rules file anymore.
      It's not there, while there's no point to rename the hwdb one.
    - Manually set udev hwdb directory (was rules dir before)
    - Don't remove the meson generated private values from pc file.
      This is now generated correctly by upstream, so no need to drop anything
      from it.
  * debian: Generate postinst devices list automatically at gbp import phase.
    Alternatively provide a script to keep the post-inst script updated
  * debian/libfprint-2-2.postinst: Upgrade as per upstream hwdb.
    Blacklisted devices can be now removed from the trigger list as we don't
    add them to plugdev anymore.
