## TOD Informations

See https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/3v1n0/libfprint/-/blob/tod/README.tod.md

## History

**LibFPrint** was originally developed as part of an
academic project at the **[University Of Manchester]**.

It aimed to hide the differences between consumer
fingerprint scanners and provide a single uniform
API to application developers.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of the **FPrint** project is to make
fingerprint scanners widely and easily usable under
common Linux environments.

## License

`Section 6` of the license states that for compiled works that use
this library, such works must include **LibFPrint** copyright notices
alongside the copyright notices for the other parts of the work.

**LibFPrint** includes code from **NIST's** **[NBIS]** software distribution.

We include **Bozorth3** from the **[US Export Controlled]**
distribution, which we have determined to be fine
being shipped in an open source project.
