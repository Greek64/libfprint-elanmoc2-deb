The libfprint-2-2 postinst script calls udevadmin trigger for all the supported
USB readers. The list of readers used in that file is generated using the gbp
import hook when `gbp import-orig` (via --uscan or with a tarball) is used.

Alternatively it can be called manually by using:

  GBP_SOURCES_DIR=. debian/update-udev-triggers.sh

When preparing a new upstream release, this script should be called against the
upstream provided .hwdb file.
